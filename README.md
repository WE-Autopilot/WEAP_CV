# ðŸš— Western Engineering AutoPilot Club: Computer Vision Perception Model ðŸš—

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Perception Model** repository! This project is part of the Western Engineering AutoPilot Club's initiative to develop an autonomous RC car with advanced perception capabilities.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository focuses on building the **Perception System**, which is responsible for enabling visual and sensory perception. The goal is to provide reliable, actionable data to support autonomous vehicle control.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope

Our primary responsibility is **perception**â€”developing the tools and systems necessary to process and interpret environmental data. We are not handling vehicle control, but our work will directly support it. 

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Visual perception (2D) for object detection, segmentation, and lane/path tracking.
- Sensory perception (3D) for environmental representation and sensor fusion.
- Mapping (2D) for object classification and alignment.

## Goals

### 1. 2D Perception:
- Detect and classify objects with bounding boxes and labels.
- Track objects across image frames, including handling track loss and recovery.
- Segment objects, lanes, and paths accurately.
- Recognize and interpret road signs.

### 2. Sensory Perception:
- Generate accurate 3D point clouds using LiDAR.
- Synchronize cameras and sensors (temporal and spatial alignment).
- Provide numeric outputs from ultrasonic sensors for vehicle context.

More to come....

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This repository is a work in progress. The technologies, tools, and detailed implementation plans will be finalized soon. Check back here for updates, and make sure to participate in onboarding steps to get up to speed!

### Key Onboarding Tasks:
- Join the **Discord** for project discussions and updates.
- Share your **GitHub username** for access to the organization.

Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
